Blood Bank Project Status Report
Challenges
Technical Challenges:
Discovery: During our implementation phase, we discovered that the integration of the third-party API for managing blood inventory is significantly more complex than initially anticipated. The API's documentation is lacking, which has caused delays in development. Adaptation: To address this, we allocated additional time for API integration and testing. We also reached out to the API's support team for assistance and adjusted our project timeline accordingly.
Non-Technical Challenges:
Discovery: Coordinating the schedules of all team members has proven to be challenging, leading to difficulties in aligning on meeting times and collaborative work sessions. Adaptation: To improve coordination, we implemented a shared team calendar and scheduled regular stand-up meetings to ensure consistent communication and progress tracking.
Collaboration/Communication
Team Collaboration:
Challenges: Initially, we faced miscommunications about task assignments, resulting in duplicated efforts and some confusion about individual responsibilities. Successes: To address this, we introduced daily stand-ups and a clear task board on Trello. These changes have significantly improved our coordination and reduced misunderstandings. We also organized in-person work sessions, which have been highly effective in resolving issues quickly and fostering team cohesion.
Individual Assistance:
Although our project is team-based, we have also benefited from external help. We received valuable feedback from mentors on optimizing our database schema, which helped us avoid potential performance issues later on. Additionally, peers have provided insights into best practices for API integration, enhancing our technical approach.
Project Updates
Database Change:
We decided to switch from MySQL to PostgreSQL for our database due to PostgreSQL's better support for some of the advanced features we need. This decision was based on technical assessments and recommendations from experienced developers.
New Feature:
Based on user feedback, we added a new feature that allows users to set up notifications for blood type shortages. This change aims to enhance the user experience and ensure timely responses to critical shortages.
Progress
Rating: 7/10
Measurement: Progress is measured by the number of completed milestones, such as setting up the database, integrating the API, and developing the user interface. We track our tasks using Trello, ensuring that each completed task moves us closer to our project goals. Explanation: We have made significant progress on the core functionalities, including the database setup and API integration. However, we are slightly behind on the front-end development due to the unforeseen complexity of the API integration. Assessment: Despite the delays, we are confident that the project will be completed on time. We have adjusted our timeline and allocated additional resources to the areas where we are behind, ensuring that we stay on track to meet our Project Proposal and MVP definition.
